Bash script for a more automated Gentoo Linux installation

"Auto Gentoo" is a bash script, which is basically a combination of
Gentoo Handbook steps, that installs Gentoo Linux from a stage3 tarball.
The overall procedure is either unattended, everything is handled by script, or fill a you go.
Installation includes "localization (English, Brazilian and Turkish),
kernel compilation, X server setup, desktop environment setup (Xfce)"
and more. These steps are enabled or disabled according to a profile.

Profile is a simple text file which has the necessary options, settings
etc. for the installation. (Profile must be named as "profile") With
a proper profile, it is possible to have a basic system (without X) or
a ready to use Xfce desktop with a few key strokes.

"Easy Gentoo" was tested on lots of machines with different profiles.
Many successful installations were made. Hope it becomes a time-saver
for you. Happy compiling!

*** IMPORTANT NOTES ***
- Easy Gentoo doesn't do partitioning, you need to do that by yourself. It formats and mounts your selection of existing partitions.
- Using a capable intallation media which has more filesystem utilities, Easy Gentoo can format, mount, configure partitions for these filesystems: "btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, ntfs, reiserfs, xfs"
- Localization is based on your "keymap". "us" is for English, "br" is for Brazilian, "trq" and "trf" are for Turkish.
- A temporary swap file with 1 GB size is created as a precaution if root partition is bigger than 8 GB
- There are two install types; basic:   doesn't include X,LightDM,Xfce,Alsa,NetworkManager,  normal:  includes X,LightDM,Xfce,Alsa,NetworkManager. Base system configuration is the same for both.
- Easy Gentoo needs an ethernet connection to operate, wireless connection is not an option for now.
- If the host computer is a laptop, some USE flag changes and additional package merges are made (these have nothing to do with wireless)
- Stable packages are used
- Based on a stage3 tarball (latest one)
- CFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"
- LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,--hash-style=gnu"
- Mirrors for Turkish users:

http://ftp.linux.org.tr/gentoo   ftp://ftp.linux.org.tr/gentoo   ftp://mirrors.linuxant.fr/distfiles.gentoo.org

- Mirrors for other users:

ftp://mirrors.linuxant.fr/distfiles.gentoo.org   http://gentoo.supp.name   http://portage.org.ua

- Portage profile is "${arch}/13.0/ for basic install" and "${arch}/13.0/desktop for normal install"
- Kernel has lots of drivers activated to help to get an error free first boot
- Grub2 is used, not Grub legacy
- No system logger and no cron included
- A few performance and security related sysctl settings are included
- sudo configuration and some aliases are included
- File manager is Thunar with automount support
- Login Manager is LightDM

*** After Using Easy Gentoo, you should check/change these ***
- Timezone
- Grub config (parameters, title)
- Startup services
- USE flags (default ones may not be enough for you)
- Mirrors
- Kernel config (it is recommended to compile a new kernel with a customized config)
- Compile list (to check if your 'must have' ones are installed)

*** How to use ***
- boot from an installation media (ex. Gentoo Minimal Install CD)
- execute these commands:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shdcn/easygentoo/master/easygentoo

chmod +x easygentoo

- create a profile in the same directory where script is placed

for more information on profile please read:

https://github.com/shdcn/easygentoo/blob/master/profile

- start script:

./easygentoo

*** Steps for basic install ***
- Check if necessary tools/commands are available to continue
- Format partitions
- Mount partitions
- Check mirrors
- Download and extract latest stage3 tarball and portage snapshot
- Continue inside chroot
- Create a temporary make.conf
- Emerge portage and some tools
- Create locale.gen
- Update make.conf and create package.use
- Do a controlled "emerge -e system"
- Kernel compilation (genkernel-next) with lots of needed settings/drivers
- Emerge grub2 and create grub.cfg
- Create/update configuration files (localtime, keymaps, hostname, etc)
- Change locale based on keymap
- Change root password and create user
- Update /etc/sudoers and .bashrc
- Unmerge unnecessary packages and do "emerge -uDN world"

*** Steps for normal install ***

- Emerge xorg-server and create xorg.conf
- Emerge and configure Xfce
- Emerge and configure LightDM
- Configure evdev
- Emerge NetworkManager
- Emerge and configure Alsa
